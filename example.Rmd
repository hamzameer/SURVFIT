#### Applying SURVFIT to the *ovarian* data-set from the **survival** package. A minimal working example.


```{r}
# load all the dependencies
library(survival)
library(ranger)
library(Rcplex)
library(SURVFIT)
```


```{r}
# load the ovarian data-set
data(ovarian)
# run the model
model <- SURVFIT(Surv(futime, fustat)~., data = ovarian)
```

#### To get the rules extracted from SURVFIT: 
```{r}
# rules extracted from SURVFIT are:
survfit_rules <- model$rules
print(survfit_rules)
```


#### To get all rules extracted and their coefficients in the model: 
```{r}
# rules extracted from SURVFIT are:
all_rules <- model$all_rules
beta <- model$beta

# printing rules and coefficients of first 10 rules
print(all_rules[1:10])
print(beta[1:10])

```
