Description: This package derives doubly sparse predictive 
    ensemble of rules from survival data using a second order cone
    formulation solved using Cplex. Double sparsity induces sparsity
    in both number of rules extracted as well as variables involved
    in the rules. This package also includes methods for comprehensive
    analysis of extracted rules such asstatistical testing,
    decomposition analysis and sensitivity analysis.
